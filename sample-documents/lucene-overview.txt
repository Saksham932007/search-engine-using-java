Apache Lucene Search Engine Library

Apache Lucene is a free, open-source information retrieval software library, originally written entirely in Java by Doug Cutting. Supported by the Apache Software Foundation, it is suitable for nearly any application that requires full-text indexing and searching capability.

Core Features:
- Scalable, high-performance indexing
- Powerful, accurate and efficient search algorithms
- Cross-platform solution
- Small RAM requirements (only 1MB heap)
- Incremental indexing as fast as batch indexing
- Index size roughly 20-30% the size of text indexed

Architecture Components:

1. Document: A collection of fields containing text or binary data
2. Field: A named piece of text or binary data within a document
3. Term: A word from text, the unit of search
4. Index: A collection of documents

Indexing Process:
The indexing process involves analyzing documents and creating an inverted index that maps each unique term to a list of documents containing that term.

Search Process:
1. Parse the query string
2. Convert query to internal representation
3. Search the index for matching documents
4. Score and rank the results
5. Return the top matching documents

Query Types:
- TermQuery: Search for documents containing a specific term
- BooleanQuery: Combine multiple queries with AND, OR, NOT
- PhraseQuery: Search for exact phrases
- WildcardQuery: Search using wildcards (* and ?)
- FuzzyQuery: Find terms similar to a given term
- RangeQuery: Search within a range of values

Analyzers:
Analyzers process text during indexing and searching. They break text into tokens and apply filters like:
- StandardAnalyzer: General purpose analyzer
- WhitespaceAnalyzer: Splits text on whitespace
- KeywordAnalyzer: Treats entire input as a single token
- LanguageAnalyzers: Language-specific analyzers

Performance Tips:
1. Use appropriate analyzers for your content
2. Optimize field storage and indexing options
3. Use proper query types for your use cases
4. Implement proper caching strategies
5. Monitor index size and performance metrics
